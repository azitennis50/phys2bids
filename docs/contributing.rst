Contributing to ``physiopy``
=============================

First of all: thank you!

Contributions can be made in different ways, not only code!
As we follow the `all-contributors`_ specification, any contribution will be recognised accordingly.

Follow these three steps to get started:

1. Have a look at the `contributor guide <contributorfile.html>`_ page as well as the `code of conduct <conduct.html>`_.
2. Make sure that you have a GitHub account. You can set up a `free GitHub <https://github.com/>_ account`.  Here are some `instructions <https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account>`_.
3. Install ``phys2bids`` as a developer. This will let you run the program with the latest modification, without requiring to re-install it every time.

Linux and mac developer installation
------------------------------------

Be sure to have git installed, then open a terminal and use the command::
``git clone https://github.com/physiopy/phys2bids.git``

Move in the ``phy2bids`` folder and execute the command::
``pip3 install -e .``

If python 3 is already your default, you might use instead::
``pip install -e .``

User testing

Coming soon.
